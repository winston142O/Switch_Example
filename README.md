# Switch_Example

(the program is in spanish)

In this C# program we can see how switches are used.

The program asks the user which one of the 4 subprograms he'd like to use, and then
it asks again in which kind of look he would like to run said subprogram. For example,
if the user wants to run subprogram 1, he gets to choose whether he'd like to run it
using a For, Do/While or While loop.
